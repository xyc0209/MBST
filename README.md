# MBST：Microservice Bad smells Testbed

## Components：

- **Bad Smells Framework (BSF)**: This framework mainly implements microservice call chain path tracing and database access tracing. The microservice system adapted to this framework generates data in the runtime phase and stores it persistently through directory mounts for runtime analysis. It consists of two parts: common and MClient.

- **Static Analysis**: This component pulls the source code and performs static code analysis locally to provide preliminary results of MBS detection.

- **Bad Smells Server (BSServer)**: This component first obtains the preliminary results, then collects the runtime data through Elasticsearch for final MBS detection, and obtains the system health status H through the assessment models.

- **Build Center**: Builds a Jenkins workflow based on the received repository address and instructions, and then sends the workflow to the Jenkins server.

- **Runtime Information Collector(MInfoCollector)**: Responsible for collecting log information generated during the runtime phase, and sending the collected information to Logstash.

- **Performance Information Collector(MContainerMetricsCollector)**: Collects the CPU and RAM usage of microservice instances by calling the Kubernetes API server interface.

- **User Request**: This component is used to simulate user requests, formulate a request queue based on business logic and send it.

- **Analysis & Display**: This component pulls the source code locally and pushes the microservices source code adapted to the BSF to the gitee repository. H is obtained through BSServer for visual presentation and management of detection results.

  Analysis & Display component is under development and will be presented later in the form of a publicly accessible platform.

## The process of deploy：

### Build

1. export `JAVA_HOME` to java 8.

2. `mvn package`. A runnable `*.jar` file should exist in `*/target/`

### Deploy Kubernetes cluster with several server nodes

1. deploy Kubernetes.
2. label each node with `node=XXX`. Replace XXX with the real node id.
3. make sure that the kubectl proxy server is running on the default port.
4. create a namespace named `kube-test` with `kubectl create namespace kube-test.

#### Microservice system for detecting
Adapt the microservice system to the BSF using the MBSTAdapter
The main workflow of the MBSTAdapter is as follows:
1. Add dependencies in pom.xml

   ```java
           <dependency>
               <groupId>MBS</groupId>
               <artifactId>MClient</artifactId>
               <version>1.0.1</version>
               <scope>compile</scope>
           </dependency>
           <dependency>
               <groupId>MBS</groupId>
               <artifactId>common</artifactId>
               <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
               <scope>compile</scope>
           </dependency>
           <dependency>
               <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
               <artifactId>spring-boot-configuration-processor</artifactId>
               <optional>true</optional>
           </dependency>
   ```


2. Modify the Controller class make it extend MObject, and add the annotation @MRestApiType to the methods of each Controller class.


3. Add the annotation @Loggable to each method in the @Repository annotated interface.


4. If there is a service invocation using RestTemplate in the method of the service implementation class, add the following code before the service invocation in the method body
   ```java
   headers.remove("Host");
   ```


5. Create a folder named config in the directory where the startup class is located (if it doesn't already exist), and in that folder create LoggableAutoConfiguration.java.

   ```java
    import com.mbs.mclient.aspect.LoggingAspect;
    import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
    import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
    import org.springframework.context.annotation.EnableAspectJAutoProxy;

    @Configuration
    @EnableAspectJAutoProxy
    public class LoggableAutoConfiguration {

   
        @Bean
        public LoggingAspect loggingAspect() {
            return new LoggingAspect();
        }
    }
   ```
   
6. Modify source code, Add @ServletComponentScan("com.septemberhx.common.filter") to the startup class of each microservice.



Then use Maven to install the microservices and then run them on a Kubernetes cluster.

#### Static Analysis

Make it run on node that are not part of the Kubernetes cluster.

#### Bad Smells Server (BSServer)

modify the code about call API of Static Analysis，and run it on node that are not part of the Kubernetes cluster.

#### Collector：MInfoCollector、MContainerMetricsCollector

Run a  MInfoCollector on each worker node，run MContainerMetricsCollector in one worker node.

#### User Request

The requests can be given through real use of deployed microservices, or through automated generation of instructions from component.
